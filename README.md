Hello everybody,

Here is the continuation of the adventures of CubDog my cube which follows like a doggie.

He uses a Raspberry Pi and OpenCV to locate people, here to simplify the code he will follow them with his head (with a single servo to turn it from left to right).

It is equipped with a webcam (under its old ultrasound eyes which are no longer used ..), a Raspberry Pi as well as a control screen. He also has 2 small arms, which fold into his stomach like Wall-E :-) The chassi is made with Makeblock pieces.

To install OpenCV on the raspberry:
